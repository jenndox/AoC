# By default, this script will build for every version of Ruby enabled in your
# versionset.

# The Ruby interpreter is the first argument. If the script exits with a
# non-zero status, the build system will not build for that interpreter.
# Use this to disable builds for some interpreters, or enable builds for
# just a specific interpreter.

# 2017Q4 conventions for Ruby interpreters use the names Ruby*x and JRuby*x,
# where the * is some sequence of numbers. Old interpreters may have names
# that don't follow the conventions.

# See the BrazilRake-2.0 documentation for more on build customization:

# Build your package for Ruby25x
[[ $1 == Ruby25x ]] || exit 1

# Build anything that we haven't tested for.
# exit 0
